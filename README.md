# An HTML5 Template
A responsive template with vanilla CSS and JS and jQuery.

[![html5 template](img/modal04-html5template.jpg)](http://joccaweb.nl/demos/html5template/)

Handy for comparing with for example Bootstrap CSS code and for creating a working layout for a site without for example Bootstrap. The layout is float-based.

Update 2018:<br>
Maybe it's advisable to replace the floats with a flex-box layout. See the credits.

### The Goal
To have an HTML5 template-site with a header, a main menu (and alternate menu), 
a footer and two mid-sections. Responsive of course, through the use of media queries. 

This template is inspired by www.lingulo.com and www.tutorialzine.com.
